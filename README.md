# Integrating Machine Learning into Environmental Engineering Education

**Repository ID:** caee-1918711  
**Context:** Supplementary material for submission to *Computer Applications in Engineering Education*.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and curriculum materials for the project **"Integrating Machine Learning into Environmental Engineering Education: Design, Implementation, and Outcomes of an Interdisciplinary Course."**

The course is designed to bridge the gap between data science and environmental engineering, providing a structured, hands-on approach to applying machine learning techniques to environmental datasets.

## Repository Structure

The curriculum is divided into **10 Modules** organized over a **5-Day** intensive schedule. All materials are provided as interactive Jupyter Notebooks.

### 📅 Day 1: Foundations
* `Module-01-day-1.ipynb`: Introduction to the course environment.
* `Module-02-day-1.ipynb`: Python basics for engineering.
* `Module-03-day-1.ipynb`: Data handling and preprocessing.
* `Module-04-day-1.ipynb`: Introduction to statistical analysis.

### 📅 Day 2: Intermediate Concepts
* `Module-05-day-2.ipynb`: Supervised learning fundamentals.

### 📅 Day 3: Advanced Modeling
* `Module-06-day-3.ipynb`: Regression and classification models.
* `Module-07-day-3.ipynb`: Model evaluation and optimization.

### 📅 Day 4: Practical Applications
* `Module-08-day-4.ipynb`: Time-series analysis for environmental data.
* `Module-09-day-4.ipynb`: Spatial data analysis.

### 📅 Day 5: Final Projects
* `Module-10-day-5.ipynb`: Case studies and capstone project integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
