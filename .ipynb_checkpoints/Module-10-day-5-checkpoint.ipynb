You will work with the dataset provided (`monitoreo_de_calidad_de_cuerpos_de_agua.csv`) to answer a relevant research question, perform analysis, interpret results, and communicate your findings effectively.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Step 1: Data Exploration and Selection\n","\n","### Download and Load the Dataset\n","- Use Python (e.g., `pandas`) to load the dataset into a DataFrame.\n","- Inspect the dataset to understand its structure, including column names, data types, and missing values.\n","\n","### Clean the Data\n","- Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., remove rows or impute values).\n","- Remove irrelevant columns if necessary.\n","\n","### Select Relevant Features\n","Based on the dataset, identify variables that could be used to answer meaningful questions about water quality. For example:\n","- Pollutant levels (`pollutant_value`)\n","- Location (`station_id`, `nombre_arroyo`)\n","- Date (`fecha`)\n","- Other environmental factors (`temperatura`, `ph`, `conductividad`, etc.)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Step 2: Formulate a Research Question\n","Propose a relevant and interesting question based on the dataset. Examples include:\n","- **Environmental Impact**: How do pollutant levels vary across different sampling stations?\n","- **Temporal Trends**: Are there seasonal patterns in water quality parameters such as pH or dissolved oxygen?\n","- **Correlation Analysis**: Is there a relationship between temperature and pollutant levels?\n","- **Threshold Violations**: Which stations exceed acceptable limits for pollutants like ammonia or phosphorus?\n","\n","Choose one question to focus on for your analysis.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Step 3: Perform Data Science Tasks\n","\n","### Data Preprocessing\n","- Convert categorical variables into numerical formats if needed (e.g., one-hot encoding).\n","- Normalize or scale features if necessary.\n","\n","### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n","- Visualize trends using plots (e.g., line charts, bar charts, scatter plots).\n","- Summarize key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for important variables.\n","\n","### Modeling (Optional)\n","- If applicable, build a predictive model (e.g., regression, classification) to address your research question.\n","- Split the data into training and testing sets using an appropriate random seed.\n","\n","### Hypothesis Testing\n","- Use statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to validate observations from your EDA.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Step 4: Calculate Metrics\n","Compute relevant metrics to evaluate your findings. Examples include:\n","- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, variance, etc.\n","- **Correlation Coefficients**: Measure relationships between variables.\n","- **Error Metrics**: If modeling, calculate RMSE, MAE, or R².\n","- **Threshold Compliance**: Count instances where pollutant levels exceed regulatory limits.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Step 5: Discuss Results\n","Write a detailed discussion section addressing the following points:\n","- What did you discover? Were your hypotheses supported by the data?\n","- What are the implications of your findings? (e.g., environmental, public health)\n","- What limitations exist in your analysis? (e.g., missing data, small sample size)\n","- Suggest areas for future research or improvements.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Step 6: Write a Paper-Like Report\n","\n","### Title\n","A concise title summarizing your research question.\n","\n","### Abstract\n","A brief summary (150–200 words) of your objectives, methods, key findings, and conclusions.\n","\n","### Introduction\n","- Introduce the dataset and its relevance.\n","- State your research question and why it matters.\n","\n","### Methods\n","- Describe your data cleaning and preprocessing steps.\n","- Explain the analytical methods and tools used (e.g., Python libraries, statistical tests).\n","\n","### Results\n","- Present your findings using tables, graphs, and metrics.\n","- Highlight significant patterns or trends.\n","\n","### Discussion\n","- Interpret your results in the context of your research question.\n","- Address limitations and suggest future work.\n","\n","### Conclusion\n","Summarize the main takeaways and their broader implications.\n","\n","### References\n","Cite any external sources or tools used.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Deliverables\n","\n","### Code Notebook\n","- Submit a Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing all your code, visualizations, and intermediate outputs.\n","- Include comments explaining each step.\n","\n","### Report\n","- Submit a PDF or Word document formatted as described above.\n","\n","### Presentation\n","- Prepare a short presentation (5–7 slides) summarizing your project for peer review."],"metadata":{"id":"yvnHiECdk4H_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"LkezRC9CvS77"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
